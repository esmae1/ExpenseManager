# ExpenseManager
Hey! this project is a java-based expense tracking application I designed to help users manage and analyse their spending. The program uses OOP principles to store, process, and present expense data efficiently. It includes functionality for adding regular expenses and discounted expenses, viewing all records, calculating totals, and identifying the highest spending item.
